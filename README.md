## Preliminary research for Mood Disorder Exacerbation Early Prediction AI Model (MDEEP Solution)
The Mood Disorder Exacerbation Early Prediction (MDEEP) Solution is an AI-driven model developed for patients with mood disorders. The aim of this project is to conduct data analysis and preliminary research to build an early prediction model for exacerbations in mood disorders. The project focuses on two main research and development (R&D) contents:

R&D Content 1: Recruitment of patients and development of customized clinical standards for solution development
R&D Content 2: Development of a prototype AI model for reactive risk prediction of mental health deterioration in patients with mood disorders

# Project Details
Programming Language: Kotlin
Development Environment: Android Studio

# Contents
The MDEEP Solution project includes the following components:

# Samsung Health Integration for Step Count
The app interacts with Samsung Health to retrieve step count data of users.

# Galaxy Watch Integration for Heart Rate
The app connects with Galaxy Watch to capture heart rate data of users.

# SFTP for Data Storage
Data collected from the app is securely transferred to the server using SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol).

# Weather, Location, and Temperature Retrieval
The app fetches weather, location, and temperature information based on the user's current location.

# Survey
The app includes a survey that collects various information related to the user's health and well-being. The survey includes the following components:

User's basic health information
Clinical Global Impression (CGI-S & I)
WHOQOL-BREF
MARS (Medication Adherence Rating Scale)
21-item HAM-D (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression)
Patient Health Questionnaire-9
Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7
Korean version of medication adherence rating scale
Korean version of insomnia severity scale
Stress Questionnaire for KNHANES
VAS (Visual Analog Scale) score
SSI (Suicidal Symptom Inventory)
Young Mania Rating Score
