# Mood Disorder Exacerbation Early Prediction (MDEEP) Solution

## Overview

The Mood Disorder Exacerbation Early Prediction (MDEEP) Solution is an AI-driven model developed for patients with mood disorders. The goal of this project is to conduct data analysis and preliminary research to build an early prediction model for exacerbations in mood disorders. By leveraging various data sources and employing artificial intelligence techniques, the MDEEP Solution aims to provide proactive insights and support for individuals with mood disorders.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of the project include:

- Conducting research and development for the MDEEP Solution
- Recruitment of patients and development of customized clinical standards for solution development
- Building a prototype AI model for reactive risk prediction of mental health deterioration in patients with mood disorders
